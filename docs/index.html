				<h1>Welcome to CaPybara!</h1>
				<p>
					CaPybara is a little tool that will help make learning Python easier. If you are new to programming, you don't need to worry about memorising everything by heart. CaPybara will already have the basics sorted for you so that you can focus on other fundamentals.

			<h1>Why was this made?</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					As GCSE students transition from a visual-based programming language to a text-based one, they often find themselves overwhelmed by the amount of new information involved.
				</p>
				<p>
					While they may have a full grasp of the fundamentals of programming, they will still have to get used to learning the semantics, syntax and specific features of the language they're moving on to.
				</p>
				<p>
					CaPybara has been created to act as a crutch during this process. It already does all the heavylifting for you, while you can continue to focus on applying the fundamentals that you have already learnt. It is entirely written in Python and has been designed to teach the same language it is written in
				</p>
			</div>
			<h1>Why Python?</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Python is known to be a very beginner-friendly language, with much of its syntax resembling plain English.</p>
				<p>Visual-based languages such as Scratch tend to condense the methods that would exist in most programming languages in a way that is simple to understand. Python is a language that is closest to this while still being used professionally. This ultimately continues to bridge the knowledge gap in such a transition.</p>
